# Getting Started

Install and run the app with the following command
```
npm i && npm start
```

# App Design Thinking Process
The app is optimised to help the user to make a booking quickly.
Therefore, the booking form is placed at the top of the app and the booking listing is placed
conveniently below the booking form so that the user can glance through all the bookings and make a booking at the same time.
The booking list is sorted according to time so that the user can easily find a time slot for their booking.

The user can also edit the booking from the current booking form without navigating away.

# Requirements
The app helps to reserve slots for your Ping Pong sessions. There are some restrictions to your booking.
- You cannot edit your booking after more than 2 minutes.
- You have to make your booking one hour apart from each booking.
- Booking can be deleted any time.

# Additional Features
Bookings are sorted according to time even for newly added booking.

# Further improvement
- Suggest some slots that the user can create.
- User cannot book time slot that is already over.
- A weekly, or monthly view can be created so that the user can navigate easily across different bookings.
- Adding password as a criteria for login

# Technical improvement
Test cases can be written to run the scenarios for each booking condition.
